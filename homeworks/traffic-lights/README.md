#Traffic Lights Exercise

1) Make it so that the buttons switch on their corresponding light,
making sure that all other lights are off

2) Try and get it so that when you mouseover a light it will come on
and when you mouseleave it will switch off

3) Try and make it automatic on a timer. You will need `setInterval`,
as described in the slides.
